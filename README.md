# Hillary vs. The Donald
In this dungeon crawler game, Hillary needs to defeat The Donald and his merry band of surrogates (plus Kellyanne Conway), in her quest to win the White House.

I made this dungeons crawler game to satisfy the requirements of [this Free Code Camp project](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-roguelike-dungeon-crawler-game), part of the Data Visualization track.

This is the mobile version. You can play the non-mobile (keyboard) version on [Codepen](http://codepen.io/ubershibs/full/xEyvgO/).

*A note on the art*: I made all the art with images that Google Image Search told me were labelled for reuse.
