# My Dungeon Crawler

## Resources I Used

## Resources That Helped Me
* Tero Parviainen's [Full-Stack Redux Tutorial](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html) - this is my first time using Redux... Tero's tutorial was a big help to my understanding of Redux and of immutable data. Also got me into writing unit tests, finally!
* Andreas Argelius' post []'Managing your React State with Redux' on Onsen.io](https://onsen.io/blog/react-state-management-redux-store/) - this was a much simpler and more directly relatable example, but wasn't as comprehensive as Tero's.
